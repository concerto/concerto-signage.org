I sent the following email to the Concerto team mailing last week, and
wanted to share it here as well. It's also a great test to see if we can
still post new content to this blog or not.  Stay tuned!

> Hello Hello!
>
> Long time no email :) I hope your December is off to a good start.
>
> I wanted to send a heads up that I'm planning to rename the Concerto "master"
> branch to something like "2.x", and substantially overhaul the codebase on a new
> "master" (or maybe "main") branch in the coming week or so.
> 
> If you have pending changes for the existing Concerto 2.x codebase, now would be
> a great time to ship them - or be on the lookout to change your target branch.
> 
> I've been slowly chipping away at bringing Concerto up to modern standards -
> Rails 8.1, Vue 3, TailwindCSS, etc and I almost have enough features working
> locally that I'm comfortable with an MVP to start getting feedback from our
> users. Demo link to come when the initial page load performance is less
> embarrassing.
> 
> Given the very inconsistent attention I've dedicated to the project over the
> past... decade?... I'm trying to optimize for long-term stability; stripping
> away all of my complicated ideas around plugins and modularity in favor of one
> big application that dependabot can keep updated on a weekly basis.
> 
> If you're interested in helping out, let me know - I'll also be cleaning up
> Github Issues to track different work items you're always welcome to grab.
> 
> Let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns!
